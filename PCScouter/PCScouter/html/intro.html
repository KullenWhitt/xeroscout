    <h2>Log Window</h2>
    <br>
    At the bottom of the main window, there is a log window that provides messages about interesting events that
    happen in the program.  Keep a close eye on this window, especially if something goes wrong.  Turning on the
    View/Debug menu item will cause more information to appear in the log window, especially during synchronization.
