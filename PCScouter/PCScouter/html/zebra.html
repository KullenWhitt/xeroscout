<BODY>
    The XeroScout scouting software provides for some new features to analyze zebra data
    from the Blue Alliance.  Zebra data is recorded during the match and provides a x/y location
    for reach robot in a given match at about 100 ms intervals.  This data can be analyzed to
    deduce information about the behaviour of a given robot.  In generaly the Zebra data support
    in the scouting program consists of:
    <ul>
        <li>Visualization of robot position data for all robots in a match</li>
        <li>Visualization of robot position data for a robot across all matches</li>
        <li>Visualization of a position heatmap for all robots in a match</li>
        <li>Visualization of a position heatmap for a robot across all matches</li>
        <li>Visual playback of the movement for all robots in a match</li>
        <li>Visual playback of the movement for a robot across all matches</li>
        <li>Analysis of rebot movement patterns</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <br>
    The analysis of robot movement patterns is experimental and consists of the following steps:
    <ul>
        <li>
            Define specific regions on the field that are interesting.  For instance, the control panel on each
            side of the field could be a region.  A region can be active for both alliances, or can be alliance specific.
        </li>
        <li>Analyze the zebra data and determine when a robot enters and exits a given region. These are stored as robot events.</li>
        <li>Analyze the zebra data and determine when the robot is sitting idle.  These are stored as robot events.</li>
        <li>
            Filter the event sequence to reduce the noise.  This means doing things like taking an event sequence like ENTER->EXIT->ENTER->EXIT
            that occurs within a single second and reducing it to a single ENTER->EXIT event sequence.
        </li>
        <li>Apply pattern matching to the event sequence to create a set of robot activities.  For instance, a sequence like ...</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Enter Loading Station Event</li>
            <li>Optional Idle Event</li>
            <li>Exit Loading Station Event</li>
            <li>Enter Control Panel Event</li>
            <li>Exit Control Panel Event</li>
            <li>Enter Tranch Event</li>
            <li>Required Idle Event</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
